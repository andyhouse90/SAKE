Square & Associations & Klickable Experience

SAKE is a visualisation tool that draws mini graphs to represent data.  Each graph takes into consideration three elements /axis: time frame, graph type(/question) and filter criteria (DataSet). 

Squares are linked, and linked squares have 2 'axis' in common.
	Timeframe & Graph Type/Question
	Timeframe & Filtering/PathBar
	Filtering/Pathbar & GraphType/Question

	Squares can take data from any source (explained later) and combine this to render a list, graph, flowchart or visualisation.... your imagination (and data source) are your limit.

The original project was based on a Rubik's Cube, with each 'layer' representing a different slice of graphs, however this new approach allows for a 'fractured glass' effect delving deeper into your questions

SAKE could be used for manual analysis or automated SOC/NOC wallboard monitors.

Additioal Notes
*****************
A new/cloned graph has *no* attributes, everything is calculated and inherited from parents.  That is to say, that if you clone 10 graphs in a row and then change #4... #5-#10 will change to inherit the change.

Whilst familiarising with the interface, it may help to have many "Info" graphs to aid the analyst with the current data presentation, however this is not compulsory.
