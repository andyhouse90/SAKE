# CSS ordering
squares-ui applies the CSS files in order, with derclarations in the last file taking precedence
Therefore it is advised you make changes in the last file, do not tamper with the first.

# squares-ui.css
Do not change !
This is the platform CSS, mostly structure
If you wish to make changes, it is advised to make them in "user.css"


# theme.css
This is the complete style, rather than change this, consider building your own entire theme.css


# user.css
Here you can make any changes, this is good for changes to colours, fonts etc.
